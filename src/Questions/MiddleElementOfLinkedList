Problem Description
Given a linked list of integers, find and return the middle element of the linked list.

NOTE: If there are N nodes in the linked list and N is even then return the (N/2 + 1)th element.



Problem Constraints
1 <= length of the linked list <= 100000

1 <= Node value <= 109



Input Format
The only argument given head pointer of linked list.



Output Format
Return the middle element of the linked list.



Example Input
Input 1:

 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
Input 2:

 1 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4


Example Output
Output 1:

 3
Output 2:

 2


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 The middle element is 3.
Explanation 2:

 The middle element in even length linked list of length N is ((N/2) + 1)th element which is 2.
